# Modron - A Multi-Purpose Tool for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition
#### Video Demo: <URL>
#### Description: 
(Created for as a final project for the CS50P Course)
Modron is a multi purpose tool created to automate the proccess of creating a character, and assist in some of the book-searching that comes up while playing them. The program serves two main proccesses to this end, the first of these being character creation.

The character creation aspect of Modron is the more complex of the two, and automates the majority of the process. First, the script generate six values. Each of these values is the result of four, six-sided dice being rolled (4 random integers in the range of 1, 6, using randint from the random library). Afterwards, the lowest of these four dice is dropped from the count, and the remainder are added. This proccess is repeated six times until there is one whole number for every Ability Score, with the lowest possible being 3 and the highest being 18. Afterwards, the user is prompted to reroll, or continue. In most actual ganes, rerolling is not allowed. Once they continue the user is prompted to assign each of these scores to an Ability among the six Ability Scores that make up a character sheet.
When the Ability Scores have been assigned, the user will again be prompted to continue. Assuming they do not return to the main function, an automatic calculation is performed in the background. In Dungeons and Dragons, for every two points above or below 10 in an Ability, the player receives either a positive or negative bonus appropriately, at a rate of 1 per 2 points difference. Bonuses are automatically calculated in the background while the player answers several basic questions in regards to Armor Class, Health, Name, and so on. The player is assumed to be starting at level 1, and as such universal traits like the movement speed are hardcoded.
At the end, a character sheet is generated, with the output using the name the player gave for their Character's name. This is done using the fillpdf library (see requirements).
In the folder for Modron there is an empty PDF named "DnD_5E_CharacterSheet_FormFillable.pdf". This file must remain untouched for the bot to function properly. Any changes made to it will be reflected in the output.

Warning: If the name given to Modron for the Character Name is the same as a pdf already present in the directory, it will be overwritten. Otherwise, as long as the character name is not identical, multiple PDF files will be generated.

The second function of Modron is the Spellbook. By connecting to the Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition api, the user is prompted to type the name of a spell (Examples for testing: Acid Arrow, Eldritch Blast, Polymorph. See https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells for a full list of the spells that Modron is capable of searching for). If the spell is not found, the user will be reprompted. If a spell is properly entered, the information will be returned in the proper format seen in the 5th Edition Player's Handbook, with the following information: name, level, school, range, description, components, materials, and the classes to which the spell is available.
